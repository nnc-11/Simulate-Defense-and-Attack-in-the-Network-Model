# Simulate-Defense-and-Attack-in-the-Network-Model
- project title:Simulate Defense and Attack in the Network Model
- course project: Hacking Exposed
- 6 members
## describe
Deploy the actual network model to perform test attacks. on a safe testing environment.
<br>Analyze the cause of the attack based on logs and traffic left behind to find the cause and provide a solution
<br>**Contributions:**
- Perform network analyzer tasks, use wireshark to detect network traffic abnormalities and provide solutions.
- Perform automatic analysis of pcap files using python through static analysis, reducing the analysis process with large traffic.
<br>**Objectives:**
- Simulated a realistic network model using 6 PCs and 1 wireless router to conduct penetration testing and analyze causes based on logs and network traffic. 
- Proposed security solutions to prevent and remediate vulnerabilities in the system. 
Technologies Used:

<br>**Security Tools:** PFSense Firewall, Suricata, ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) 
<br>**Network Tools:** Wireshark, DNS Server (BIND) 
<br>**Pentesting Tools:** Kali Linux, Nmap, SQLmap
